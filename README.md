### Rules

Two players compete against eachother by controlling a paddle by moving it vertically up and down the left or right side of the screen. Players use the paddles to hit a moving ball back and forth across the screen. The goal is for each player to score 5 points before their opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other side.


### Controls

- Player 1 controls their paddle up with the **[a]** key and down with the **[z]** key.

- Player 2 controls their paddle up with the **[']** key and down with the **[/]** key.

### Backlog

My biggest hurdle was getting the ball to move and bounce around the gameboard. 
Features I would like to add in the future are different difficulty levels and a 1 player mode where you can battle a bot.
