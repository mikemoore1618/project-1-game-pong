# project-1-game-pong
This is a repository for our first project at General Assembly Web Development Fundamentals. The assignment was to create a game and the game I chose to make was pong. Technologies I used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.
Pong 

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis, or Ping Pong.

Rules:

Each player controls a paddle by moving it vertically up and down the left or right side of the screen. Players can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The goal is for each player to score 5 points before their opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other side.


Controls: 

Player 1 controls their paddle up and down with the [a] and [z] keys.
Player 2 controls their paddle with the ['] and [/] keys

Known Bugs: 

When player 1 or player 2 misses the ball, but comes really close to hitting it, the ball glitches and acts like it was hit, but still scores a point.
