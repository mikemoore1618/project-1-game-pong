### Rules

Each player controls a paddle by moving it vertically up and down the left or right side of the screen. Players can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The goal is for each player to score 5 points before their opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other side.


### Controls

- Player 1 controls their paddle up with the **[a]** key and down with the **[z]** key.

- Player 2 controls their paddle up with the **[']** key and down with the **[/]** key.

- JavaScript- often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
- jQuery- a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin
