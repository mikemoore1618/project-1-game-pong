### Rules

Each player controls a paddle by moving it vertically up and down the left or right side of the screen. Players can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The goal is for each player to score 5 points before their opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other side.


### Controls

- Player 1 controls their paddle up with the **[a]** key and down with the **[z]** key.

- Player 2 controls their paddle up with the **[']** key and down with the **[/]** key.
