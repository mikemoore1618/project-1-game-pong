# project-1-game-pong
This is a repository for our first project at General Assembly Web Development Fundamentals. The assignment was to create a game and the game I chose to make was pong. Technologies I used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

<h1>Pong</h1>

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis, or Ping Pong.

<h2>Rules</h2>

Each player controls a paddle by moving it vertically up and down the left or right side of the screen. Players can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The goal is for each player to score 5 points before their opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other side.


<h2>Controls</h2> 

Player 1 controls their paddle up with the **[a]** key and down with the **[z]** key.

Player 2 controls their paddle up with the **[']** key and down with the **[/]** key.

<h2>Known Bugs</h2> 

When player 1 or player 2 misses the ball, but comes really close to hitting it, the ball glitches and acts like it was hit, but still scores a point.
